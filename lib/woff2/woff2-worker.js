/**
 * Etch Font Manager — WOFF2 conversion worker.
 *
 * Runs the google/woff2 encoder compiled to WebAssembly. Font bytes are
 * converted here and never leave the browser; the plugin uploads the WOFF2
 * result exactly as if the user had picked that file themselves.
 *
 * This has to be a worker. Compressing a font takes on the order of a second
 * or two per file, and the Etch builder is sitting on the same main thread.
 *
 * Protocol
 *   in  { id, type: 'convert', buffer }   ArrayBuffer, transferred
 *   in  { id, type: 'decode', buffer }    ArrayBuffer, transferred
 *   out { type: 'ready' }
 *   out { id, type: 'done', buffer }      ArrayBuffer, transferred
 *   out { id, type: 'error', error }
 *
 * Decoding is not the converter's job and never reaches a file the user keeps:
 * it unwraps a WOFF2 far enough to read one table out of it, because a variable
 * font that arrives already compressed carries its axes where nothing can see
 * them otherwise.
 *
 * woff2.js and woff2.wasm are built by .github/workflows/build-wasm.yml.
